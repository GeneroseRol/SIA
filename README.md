As a student whose taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology Major in Networking, at first when i saw the course System Integration and Architecture, I feel both curious and excited about what I’m going to learn. I expect that this course will gave me a better understanding of how various systems, programs, and technologies are connected. It matters to me because almost everything these days relies on technology working together, and I want to know and understand how that happens.

I also believe this course will provide me with an opportunity to learn from practical examples that will help me to improve more and build more skills. I also expect going through activities and  lessons that will make me/us gain a lot of knowledge. I hope i can learn techniques and tools that can be applied in real-life projects/scenario. So that this can help me build confidence in solving technical challenges.

All in all, I expect this course to help me grow and improve my skills in problem-solving and critical thinking. Also, I hope to be more confident in analyzing, designing, and understanding systems. I’m looking forward how this course will benefit me as i continue the path i'm taking right now.
